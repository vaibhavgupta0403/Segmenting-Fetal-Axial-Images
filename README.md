# Segmenting-Fetal-Axial-Images
To develop an algorithm that is capable of identifying the biparietal diameter and occipitofrontal diameter landmark points in fetal axial images.

Process :
A lightweight deep convolutional neural network, referred to as the CSM method, was
proposed for efficient and accurate fetal head segmentation from ultrasound images.
Post-processing techniques, including morphological processing and least-squares
ellipse fitting, were applied to obtain the fetal head circumference. Due to computational
constraints, the model was trained for only 20 epochs with a reduced batch size of 8.
